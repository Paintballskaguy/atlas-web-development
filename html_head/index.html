  <h1>Welcome To John's World</h1>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    Hi there! I‚Äôm <b>John Wilson</b>, a dedicated full-stack development student at Atlas School, 
    with a passion for building innovative digital solutions. 
    My goal is to either <span class="highlight">launch my own web development agency</span> or contribute to 
    a dynamic team at a leading tech company to continue growing my expertise.
  </p>
    <p>
      Beyond coding, I‚Äôm also an entrepreneur. My wife and I proudly own the Boman Twin Event Center, a versatile music and event venue designed to host everything from live performances to vendor fairs.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Entrepreneurship</b> has always been in my blood. I previously owned a small hot dog cart called John's Diggity Dogs, where I‚Äôd serve customers right down the street from Caz's Bar and at local events around town. My wife and I also owned Inflate 918, a bounce house rental company offering bounce houses, waterslides, and obstacle courses to families and businesses in our community. After several successful years, we sold Inflate 918 to focus on building and growing our event center.
    </p>
    <p>
    I hold a <strong class="degree">Bachelor's degree in Business Management</strong> from <strong class="OKschool">Oklahoma State University</strong> in Tulsa and earned my Associate's degree in <strong class="degree">Business Management and Entrepreneurship</strong> from <strong class="KSschool">Haskell Indian Nations University</strong> in Lawrence, Kansas. With 6 years of IT support experience and 5 years of management expertise, I bring a blend of technical know-how and leadership skills to every project I tackle.
    </p>
 </div>
    <div class="Why">
        <h3>Why I Chose Atlas School and Full-Stack Development</h3>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve always been drawn to problem-solving and building things from scratch, whether in business or technology. After spending years in IT support, I realized I wanted to be on the creative side of technology ‚Äî designing and building solutions rather than just maintaining them.
        </p>
      <p>
        I chose Atlas School because of its comprehensive curriculum, hands-on approach, and focus on real-world skills. Full-stack development felt like the perfect fit because it combines both front-end creativity and back-end logic, allowing me to see projects through from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also picked Atlas because my brother had already enrolled and was encouraging me to join him. We‚Äôre competitive siblings, and I couldn‚Äôt stand the idea of him being better at IT than me. It‚Äôs all friendly competition, but it definitely gave me the extra push to dive in.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for full-stack development, it matches my personality perfectly. I‚Äôve always been a <b>jack of all trades and master of none</b>, and that‚Äôs exactly what a full-stack developer is ‚Äî someone who can handle both front-end and back-end development without missing a beat.
      </p>
      <h3>What I Want To Do with My Full-Stack Knowledge</h3>
        <p>My Goal with full-stack development is twofold:</p>
          <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li><b>Start My Own Agency:</b> I envision running a web development agency that focuses on building custom digital solutions for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and community organizations.</li>
            <li><b>Gain Experience in a Larger Tech Company:</b> I‚Äôm also open to joining a larger tech firm to expand my knowledge, collaborate with experienced developers, and refine my skills on larger-scale projects.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>
          No matter which path I take, my ultimate goal is to build impactful, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.
        </p>

    <div class="Roots">
      <h3>Roots & Adventures</h3>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm a proud Tulsan, but life has taken me on some incredible journeys. I‚Äôve worked in minor league baseball, supporting teams in Tulsa, OKC, Frisco (TX), South Bend (IN), Chicago (IL), and Arkansas. My time spent living in Lawrence, Kansas, during college also holds a special place in my story.
      </p>
      </div>
    <div class="Hobbies">
      <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
      <p>
         When I‚Äôm not coding or managing events, you‚Äôll find me enjoying video games, hitting the trails on bike rides, or strategizing on the paintball field ‚Äî a hobby I hope to revisit once life settles into a steady rhythm.
     </p>
    </div>
        <div class="Pets">
          <h3>Meet the Pets</h3>
          <p>
            Our home wouldn‚Äôt be complete without our two furry family members ‚Äî Rux and Neville.
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>üêæ <strong>Rux:</strong> An American Pitbull/Lab mix, Rux is our anxious old man with a heart of gold. He‚Äôs incredibly protective of his family, but if you offer him butt scratches and a tasty snack, you‚Äôll have a friend for life.</li>
              <li>üêæ <strong>Neville:</strong> Often described as a land seal, Neville is our cuddle bug who believes every lap was made just for him. He's an bully pitty and he‚Äôs also our nanny dog, always keeping a watchful eye on our boys. If they‚Äôre up to something naughty, you can count on Neville to come tell on them ‚Äî he takes his responsibilities very seriously.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Together, Rux and Neville add warmth, laughter, and a little bit of chaos to our lives.
          </p>
    <p class="end">I‚Äôm excited about the road ahead, whether it‚Äôs building cutting-edge websites, growing our event business, or simply spending quality time with my family.

      Let‚Äôs connect and create something amazing together!</p>
