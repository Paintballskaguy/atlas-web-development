# Personal Website For John

Read me for the web development project. This is my read me that has substance and character. Can you feel it? It's got HTML, CSS and some Javascript. Just a little though.

## Helpful Tips

- Always put everything inside of a <dev>
- Once you type it out, copy and paste the same <IMG> code everytime you want to use it again.
- Use one CSS file. To keep it consisitant. 
- Always use the same class names so the CSS will be consistent.
