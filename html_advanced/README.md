# HTML Advanced
## This is the read me for the HTML structure project.

### Things that I learned
- Div inside of a Div inside of a div to help contol the styling and focus it.
- .blue will auto complete into <div class="blue"></div>
- mapping out the site is superhelpful
- making sure the div's are class labeled helps with style, readability and planning.
- I hope you like the office, because Michael Scott is all over the place.

## Pre-planning
- mapping out the site with functions and what it will need will save SOOOO much time.
- planning out what each button and link does will be so useful.
